I designed and built AI/LLM-driven fitment systems at Amazon that match any automotive part or accessory to the right vehicle. From filters to tires to complex components, my large langauge models eliminate guesswork and give shoppers confidence before they click “Buy.”

I turned that question into an AI challenge. I architected and launched an AI/LLM-powered compatibility engine across Amazon’s massive catalog — spanning electronics, accessories, home goods and beyond — so customers instantly know what fits with what, reducing uncertainty and returns at scale.
